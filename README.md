A app by Emma Blaido in Django and python

Our app is designed to be a gentle approach for those who are struggling or are prone to mental health issues, while we are not a replacement for proper medical treatment, we do believe that steps can be taken to prevent or lessen the effects of depression and anxiety.

studies have shown that through proper sleep, diet, and exercise one has a greater chance of preventing relapses, and through small self-care acts one can naturally produce serotonin to help in deep depressive episodes.

the user can select from several informational resources or therapies to learn more about daily habits that could be affecting their mental health or small steps they could take to improve their state of mind 

the user may also create an account to log triggers, mood swings, and general feelings either in depressive episodes or continuously journal as an act of self-care, keeping a record of the highs and lows is a wonderful way to deeper understand what one may be struggling with, with understanding comes to the power to identify more effective forms of treatment, "what works best for me?" "what triggered me so hard last time?" "how did I come out of it?" "how long did it last?" being able to answer these questions will help our users in the long run which is why we have a search feature readily available to find old journals.


For this project I used several GA-provided notations on Django and python functions, including but not limited too, "Django URLs, Views, and Templates " "Django models" "Django deployment" I also received assistance from my Pod leader and the office hours instructor (thank you to you both) 

technologies used were Django, Python, SQL, html, bulma css, static 

to run my app, please fork and clone my repo, and install the necessary technologies, 

in your terminal
pip3 install pipenv 
pipenv install django 
pipenv shell
python3 manage.py runserver

• Daily reminders 
• dates posted 
•more in-depth informaional pages 
• therapist talk lines 
•pages for outreach programs
